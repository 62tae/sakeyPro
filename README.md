# Angular2 시작방법

$npm start

진행해주면 기본 설치 완료

@에러 발생시(Angular JS 2 Doc)
Scary error messages in red may appear during install. The install typically recovers from these errors and finishes successfully.

npm errors and warnings

All is well if there are no console messages starting with npm ERR! at the end of npm install. There might be a few npm WARN messages along the way — and that is perfectly fine.

We often see an npm WARN message after a series of gyp ERR! messages. Ignore them. A package may try to re-compile itself using node-gyp. If the re-compile fails, the package recovers (typically with a pre-built version) and everything works.

Just make sure there are no npm ERR! messages at the end of npm install.
